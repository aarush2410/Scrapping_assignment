Governments and businesses are searching for solutions which avoid significant investment into new storage, transport and liquification infrastructure, and limit risks associated with potentially toxic or dangerous alternatives.\nWe position hydrogen as the commodity to deliver decarbonisation for global industry and mobility sectors. Our transformative LOHC technology provides a safe, low cost means of bulk hydrogen storage and transportation, establishing the critical link between supply and demand on a regional, national, and international level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are at the forefront of hydrogen technology, providing solutions for a rapid energy transition. There is a strong conviction in the competitive positioning of our LOHC compared with other hydrogen carriers such as liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen and ammonia. Together with existing and new partners we will make large-scale green hydrogen transport and supply a reality to decarbonize industry and mobility worldwide. Following on from its successful fundraise, Hydrogenious LOHC will continue to drive the industrialization and scale up of its stationary and onboard LOHC systems.\nDr Daniel Teichmann, CEO and founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors see LOHC as key in driving the energy transformation and going net zero.\n\n\n\n\nKevin Eggers, Founding Partner of AP Ventures",

Governments and businesses are searching for solutions which avoid significant investment into new storage, transport and liquification infrastructure, and limit risks associated with potentially toxic or dangerous alternatives.\nWe position hydrogen as the commodity to deliver decarbonisation for global industry and mobility sectors. Our transformative LOHC technology provides a safe, low cost means of bulk hydrogen storage and transportation, establishing the critical link between supply and demand on a regional, national, and international level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are at the forefront of hydrogen technology, providing solutions for a rapid energy transition. There is a strong conviction in the competitive positioning of our LOHC compared with other hydrogen carriers such as liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen and ammonia. Together with existing and new partners we will make large-scale green hydrogen transport and supply a reality to decarbonize industry and mobility worldwide.
